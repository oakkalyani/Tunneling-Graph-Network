# Tunneling-Graph-Network
Build a network of tunnels for Plano TX (replicating the idea of Boring Co. to TX)

The proect aims to improve connectivity in the state of Texas (Plano) 
Use of network analysis to: 
- Identify important transportation hotspots in Plano 
- Plan for alternative routes to multiple destinations 
- Efficient traffic analysis

Analysis has been done using concepts of centrality, clustering, diffusion, flow and percolation amongst other techniques to rank the importance of nodes and to generate and compare potential tunneling maps
Network dynamics modelling is implemented to visualize how traffic/gridlock percolates across the network and assess the impact of easing a single node and its diffusion through the network
Real-time analysis and interactive visualization built using Python and D3.
